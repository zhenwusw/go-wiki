1. Design for Faults

2. Design with Dependencies in Mind

3. Design with the Domain in Mind

4. Design with Promises in Mind

5. Distributed Systems Management

## Some quick questions about the manageability of a microservices deployment

- How do we start and stop a fleet of services?

- How do we aggregate logs/metrics/SLAs across microservices?

- How do we discover services in an elastic environment where they can be coming, going, moving, etc.?

- How do we do load balancing?

- How do we learn about the health of our cluster or individual services

- How do we restart services that have fallen over?

- How do we do fine-grained API routing?

- How do we secure our services?

- How do we throttle or disconnect parts of a cluster if it starts to crash or act unexpectedly?

- How do we deploy multiple versions of a service and route to them appropriately?

- How do we make configuration changes across a large fleet of services?

- How do we make changes to our application code and configu‚Äê ration in a safe, auditable, repeatable manner?
